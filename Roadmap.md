# The past #

Afloat began in June '06 as a simple idea on a computer. It still is, although steps were taken to make it more
organized and as open as possible.

Afloat released the following versions:

  * Beta 1, a hastily thrown together SIMBL plug-in that was the basis for all subsequent work.
  * Beta 2 and Beta 3 and a host of other sub-variants (collectively referred to as "Legacy"); the latest version of this
development branch (bundle version 3,0, visible version "1.0 (pre-release 3)") is the "stable" version offered on the
[Afloat web site](http://afloat.infinite-labs.net).
  * Beta 4 was released after a four-months hiatus, during which Afloat was rewritten from scratch. It is considered
to be an experimental branch and will remain so.
